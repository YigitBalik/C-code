Write a C program that will get the target value and a sequence of throws from the
user, and tracks the point value along the game. The user will input each throw by
giving its segment and ring. For example, 17 D will represent a double 17, 8 T will
represent a triple 8, and 15 S will represent a single 15. The outer and inner bulls will
be represented by an O and an I, respectively, and in those cases, the segment value
will be ignored.
