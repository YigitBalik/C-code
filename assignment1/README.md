Write a C program that will get a date and an end year from the user and print which
weekday that date corresponds to, along with the number of the years when the
same day-and-month falls on the same weekday, starting from the next year until the
user supplied end year.
For example, if the user gives the date as 1900-1-1 and the end year as 1999, the
program should report that the date 1900-1-1 is a Monday and how many more dates
in the form YYYY-1-1 fall on a Monday, where YYYY are the years between 1901 and
1999 (14 of the January 1â€™s in that year range fall on a Monday).
Your program should also check whether the date given by the user is valid or not.
